# Live Preview

!!!info
Live Preview is a feature that allows you to see your content in real time as you are creating it. This feature is available in the Textuality Content Editor. Please note this is not how your content will look when published, but it will give you a good idea of how it will look in a specified template.

Live preview just like everything else in Textuality is easy to use. You can find the live preview button in the top right corner of the editor. Live preview has multiple small features that can help you with your content creation process.
